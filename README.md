**Arduino-Simulation**

Welcome to my Arduino Simulation Projects repository! This repo contains various beginner-friendly Arduino projects simulated using Tinkercad. Each project includes PDF and schemitic view  for easier understanding. Whether you're a newbie exploring Arduino or just want some inspiration for your own projects, youâ€™ll find this helpful! 



**Tinkercad Arduino Simulations**


This repository contains a collection of Arduino simulation projects developed using Tinkercad Circuits. Each project demonstrates key concepts in embedded systems, automation, and sensor integration using the Arduino platform. These simulations are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience without the need for physical hardware.






 **Project Overview**
 

The projects in this repository showcase fundamental Arduino applications through Tinkercad simulations. Each simulation focuses on solving real-world problems using sensors, actuators, and microcontroller logic.





**Tools Used**


Tinkercad Circuits 
Arduino UNO (Simulated) 
Servo Motors, Ultrasonic Sensors, Buzzers, LEDs, Keypads etc.
Programming Language: Arduino (C/C++)
