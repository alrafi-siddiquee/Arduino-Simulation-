# Arduino-Simulation

Welcome to my Arduino Simulation Projects repository! This repo contains various beginner-friendly Arduino projects simulated using Tinkercad. Each project includes PDF and schemitic view  for easier understanding. Whether you're a newbie exploring Arduino or just want some inspiration for your own projects, you‚Äôll find this helpful! 


**Tinkercad Arduino Simulations**

This repository contains a collection of Arduino simulation projects developed using Tinkercad Circuits. Each project demonstrates key concepts in embedded systems, automation, and sensor integration using the Arduino platform. These simulations are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience without the need for physical hardware.

 **Project Overview**

The projects in this repository showcase fundamental Arduino applications through Tinkercad simulations. Each simulation focuses on solving real-world problems using sensors, actuators, and microcontroller logic.

Example Projects:

Smart Parking System 
Sound-Activated Lighting 
Password-Protected Door Lock 
Smart Hand Sanitizer Dispenser 

Technologies and Tools

Hardware (Simulated): Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor, LCD Display, Buzzer, LEDs, and more
Simulation Platform: Tinkercad Circuits
Programming Language: Arduino (C/C++)

** Live Simulations**

You can explore and run the simulations directly Tinkercad:
